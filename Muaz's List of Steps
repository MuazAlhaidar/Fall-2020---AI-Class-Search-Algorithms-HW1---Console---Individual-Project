Steps for DFS:
    1. Mark current node as visited
        1-1. Add node to the explored set (.number, node_IDS)
        1-2. Pop node off of frontier set
        1-3. If node is available, mark it as visited
             if it is instead the final goal, then the search is done

    2. Get neighbors of node
        2-1. Get all available childen of node
        2-2. Filter them to get only unexplored nodes
             by checking if they are in exploredSet
     
    3. If the neighbors list is empty then
        this branch is a dead end

    4. Assign a number to all of the neighboring nodes
       so that they can be printed later on
       and also be added to the explored list
       
    5 Add nodes to node grid so they can be displayed
      later on with the print map function

    6. Push the neighbors onto the frontier stack
       so we can explore them

    7. If the frontier stack is empty then we have failed the search

    8. For the amount of neighbors of the current node
       run the search to explore all if the options
       until we fund the GOAL, and if that doesnt happen
       then we fail
